# RNA-sequencing course - Part 2: Quality Control


## Aim of part 2:
The aim of this part is to check the quality of the reads from all samples using FastQC and MultiQC.


## Procedure and organization of this part:
1. The Illumina sequencing data (fastq files) were copied from the RNA-seq course folder into the private folder.
2. A list containing the sample numbers as well as the path to the r1 and r2 file of the samples was created.
3. The quality of all samples was controlled using FastQC. All files were run in parallel using SLURM job arrays.
4. A MultiQC was done to summarize the FastQC of all samples.  


## RNA-sequencing folder structure:
- Each step of the project has its own direcory.
- Folder structure created with 00_Setup_directories_of_02_QC.sh
