# RNA-sequencing course


## Aim of the project:
The aim of this project is to detect differentially expressed genes from bulk RNA-seq data. The project includes ...


## Procedure of the project:
1. Project organization / Getting started: The directory structure, README and the genaral outline of the project is created.
2. Quality checks: FastQC is run to assess the quality of the data.
3. Map reads to the reference genome


## RNA-sequencing folder structure:
- Each step of the project has its own direcory.
- Folder structure created with setup_directories.sh


## Technical information:
- The fastq files of the dataset are located at: /data/courses/rnaseq_course/toxoplasma_de
- The project workflow is in the following html file: https://ilias.unibe.ch/goto_ilias3_unibe_file_3222709_download.html
